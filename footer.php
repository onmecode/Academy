              Sky's Get into Tech initiative aims to provide a unique and supportive environment in 
            which women with little or no previous technical experience can learn some of the skills 
            necessary to begin a career in software development. Sky recognises the significant lack 
            of gender diversity in the technology industry, and we believe that encouraging capable, 
            talented women into technical roles can bring enormous benefits, both to the women themselves, 
            and also to the teams and companies they end up working with. 
            By introducing more women into this talent pool, we hope to increase diversity in Technology at Sky.

            The courses provide beginner level training which aim to give people the skills necessary to apply 
            for entry level jobs in software development. By the end of one of our courses you will be equipped
            with the technical skills you need to start building websites and applications, have an understanding 
            and some experience of Agile ways of working in software development, and you will have built your very 
            own original software project as part of a team. We hope you will leave the Academy inspired and empowered, 
            and in a strong position to apply for Junior software developer roles should you wish to.
